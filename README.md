CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fundamental operations used in most database interactions. In a React application, you can implement CRUD operations to manage data within your components. Here's a basic overview of how you can approach implementing CRUD operations in a React application:

Create (Add/Submit):

Create a form component where users can input data.
Handle form submission to send data to your backend server or manage state locally if it's not connected to a backend.
Update the state or trigger a server request to add the new data to your database.
Read (Retrieve):

Fetch data from your backend server using FakeAPIs (e.g fakestoreapi).
Store fetched data in the component's state.
Render the data in your component using JSX.
Update (Edit):

Create an edit form or modal component populated with the existing data.
Allow users to modify the data.
Upon submission, update the state or send a request to the server to update the data.
Delete:

Add a delete button or action associated with each data item.
Upon user interaction, remove the item from the state or send a request to the server to delete it.
